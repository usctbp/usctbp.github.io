		<p>Tau Beta Pi is a national engineering honor society dedicated to promoting honor, integrity, scholarship, and exemplary character in the field of Engineering. Founded in 1885, it now encompasses over 215 educational institutions nationwide.</br></br>

Undergraduate students whose scholarship places them in the top eighth of their class in their next-to-last year or in the top fifth of their class in their last college year are eligible for membership consideration. These scholastically eligible students are further considered on the basis of personal integrity, breadth of interest both inside and outside engineering, adaptability, and unselfish activity.</br></br>

Engineering graduate students whose scholarship places them in the top fifth of their graduate class or whose high-quality work is attested to by a faculty member may be elected to membership.</br></br>

Engineering alumni of a chapter's institution or of another recognized institution whose scholastic record placed them in the top fifth of their class may be elected to membership. Such candidates are usually recommended to the chapter by a member who knows them.</br></br>

Students who qualify will be contacted by standard mail and e-mail.</p>
