						<!-- <h3>This is a subheading</h3> -->
						<p>If you are reading this, you have most likely been asked to join Tau Beta Pi and are wondering why choose this organization among other honor programs. Being one of the oldest honor societies in the United States and upholding strict academic standards, entrance into TBP gets you recognition from the faculty here at USC and other universities, as well as that of professionals in industry.</br></br>

As part of Tau Beta Pi, you will often find yourself with unique opportunities to connect with recruiters from the top corporations, or will gain privileged access to networking opportunities organized by both Viterbi and TBP. More importantly, it is a great opportunity to connect with like-minded people, and forge long lasting bonds with engineers across the full spectrum of disciplines.</br></br>

To that end, TBP strives to create events that allow us to get to know one another and often give back to the community at the same time. If anything else, we also tend to give free pizza; think about it.
